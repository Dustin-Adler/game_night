# Game Night
Welcome to game night! It's a sad fact of life that as we age we tend to get busier and busier. But in our free time we still like to do fun things don't we. Here in lies the problem. All of the fun things that we want to do involve getting our friends and family together, but they have also aged and become busy! Ok so we try to make plans. I call Jake, Jake calls Mellissa, Mellissa can't make it on Friday, so Jake calls me back to ask if I can move it to Saturday. I tell him that I've got a thing Saturday night ... And so it goes. We wind up in the worst part of scheduling hell. Wait, what's that you say! Game Night can solve this problem! No Way! Tell me more ... 

Game Night is a light weight user friendly application that you and your friends, family, and work buddies can use to schedule what matters most in life. GAME TIME! Everyone downloads the app, uploads their schedule and joins the group.
